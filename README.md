## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Background

As a leading producer of chemicals, ChemCorp has observed that market demand has been strong over the past few years with growth averaging 7% Year-on-Year. With favourable growth rates and lowered barriers to entry due to government regulation, this has attracted increased competition.

ChemCorp didn’t think these competitors were a primary concern until recently when discussions with ﬁve long-term customers revealed that ChemCorp was no longer these ﬁrms’ preferred provider of chemicals. After these customers left, the sales management team found that ~10% of sales revenue came from these customers. If this trend were to continue unchecked, ChemCorp’s market share and potential customer-base would gradually erode, damaging the board’s conﬁdence in existing management. This unchecked trend could also indicate a potential risk in the company’s ability to make dividend payments to shareholders if losses prove to be too steep.

More details about the project can be found in the case study overview file.

### 1.2. Objectives

The main focus of the project is: **“How can ChemCorp prevent the loss of future market share through the identiﬁcation of future growth industries and identiﬁcation of at least one divestment product in at least one of our industries?”**
* Customer Strategy
* Market Opportunities
* Product Divestment

## 2. Analysis

### 2.1. Geographical Distribution

![Geographical Distribution](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/ChemCorp-Incorporated/blob/main/Images/1.%20Geographical%20Distribution.png)

Firstly, to understand the customer, it is best that ChemCorp determine which regions are the key factors for their success. Here, it can be seen that California, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas are the states that have generated huge revenue for ChemCorp.

In addition, the cost per product provides great insight. States in Mountain and North Central regions cost the most for each product to be produced, while not generating sufficient revenue compared to other regions or states.

California, New York and Pennsylvania are the top 3 states of the revenues for the company. Overall, Paper and Packaging is the dominant business type in all states with half of all revenues.

### 2.2. Industry Analysis

![Industry Analysis](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/ChemCorp-Incorporated/blob/main/Images/2.%20Industry%20Analysis.png)

As expected, Paper and Packaging holds half of the total revenue for the company (51.28%), followed by Aerospace Defense and Machinery and Industrial Goods. However, the Paper and Packaging industry actually has the lowest profit margin of only 50.48%, followed by Aerospace Defense (52.92%). Regarding customers, Paper and Packaging has the most customers, whereas Aerospace Defense has the second least customers. Nonetheless, it is still considerable that Aerospace Defense is an area attracting the most revenue for ChemCorp.

Machinery and Industrial Goods stands out as the third most revenue industry, the second highest profit margin, while having the largest number of customers.

The Pharmaceuticals industry, although doesn’t generate much revenue (the least of all business types), has a fairly acceptable profit margin, and a sustainable amount of customers.

By contrast, Medical Equipment gains low revenue compared to others, and has the least customers (only 69 customers).

### 2.3. Product Analysis

![Product Analysis](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/ChemCorp-Incorporated/blob/main/Images/3.%20Product%20Analysis.png)

ChemCorp needs to make sure its capital is spent in products which may have sustainable potential.

Chemical K attracts the most revenue, which is understandable, since it’s the leading product in the leading industry: Paper and Packaging. In fact, Paper and Packaging dictates the top 3 most profitable products: Chemical K, Chemical H, and Chemical I. Moreover, Chemical D is the top product for Aerospace Defense and Biotechnology.

Regarding profit margin, Chemical A performs poorly, as they barely generate any profit, not to mention encountering loss in Biotechnology and Medical Equipment (up to 21.97% of loss). Also, Chemical B produces a low percentage of profit-revenue compared to other products.

Chemical E has a great profit margin, >80% for all industries.

### 2.4. Seasonality

![Seasonality](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/ChemCorp-Incorporated/blob/main/Images/4.%20Seasonality.png)

In terms of month-over-month revenue and total sales seasonality, both the revenue steadily decreased from June to September, even though the number of orders did increase in July. The performance of the company reached its peak during March, May, and October, surpassing other months. December, although the order count went up, the revenue unusually fell 11.3% compared to November.

In terms of the number of orders, Chemical D and E are quite successful in the market. Specifically, these products have performed quite well over the year, with Chemical D and E having had the most and second most orders, respectively.

On the other hand, Chemical A, J, and G are the most underperformed products. The number of orders for Chemical A and J is incredibly low compared to other products. Chemical G has the third lowest number of orders over the months.

### 2.5. Sales, Revenue & Cost

![Sales, Revenue & Cost](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/ChemCorp-Incorporated/blob/main/Images/5.%20Sales%2C%20Revenue%20%26%20Cost.png)

Not only Chemical A, Chemical J, and Chemical G have the least orders, they also generate low value, while cost the most. Every other product has the average cost per unit of less than $3, but Chemical A, J, and Chemical G have a whopping cost of more than $15, 5 times more costly than the others.

Chemical K, the leading product in revenue, is actually ordered quite little compared to other products.

### 2.6. Negative Profit Margin

![Negative Profit Margin](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/ChemCorp-Incorporated/blob/main/Images/6.%20Negative%20Profit%20Margin.png)

Of all products, Chemical A is in a critical situation. In many states, including the top 3 states of revenue (California, New York, and Pennsylvania), Chemical A suffers loss, even huge loss. Furthermore, this product suffers loss in 6 months of the whole year.

## 3. Summary

### 3.1. Location and seasonality

* Top states: California, New York, Pennsylvania
* Top month: March, May, October
* July and December should be investigated more for deeper insights.

### 3.2. Industries

* Paper and Packaging: the main form of business for ChemCorp - half of all revenue, and may dictate the trend in figures, but unfortunately has the lowest profit margin.
* Aerospace Defense: second largest source of revenue, second lowest profit margin, second least customers.
* Machinery and Industrial Goods: a very potential industry - the third most revenue, the second highest profit margin, most customers.
* Biotechnology: largest profit margin with fairly low revenue.
* Pharmaceuticals: the least revenue but a fair profit margin, and a good amount of customers.
* Medical Equipment: low revenue and least customers.

### 3.3.  Products

* Chemical K: most revenue (due to being the leading product in Paper and Packaging), but low orders
* Chemical D: most orders through months. Chemical D performs the top product for Aerospace Defense and Biotechnology, while Chemical E is the most efficient product regarding profit margin,
* Chemical A: product with worst performance. Chemical A has the least orders throughout the year, generates the lowest revenue, and costs the most. This product also brings loss to the company, industry-wise, location-wise, and time-wise.
* Chemical J: product with second worst performance - second least orders, second lowest revenue, second most cost per unit, and all these figures are nearly the same with Chemical A.
* Chemical G: product in question: third least orders, third lowest revenue, third most cost per unit. In terms of orders and revenue, this product is nowhere as underperformed as Chemical A and J, but regarding the cost, Chemical G should be taken into consideration.


## 4. Suggestions

### 4.1. Customer Strategy

* Investigate market demand and feasibility in California, New York, and Pennsylvania to identify key factors influencing customer behaviour in these states, so as to expand this success to other states.
* Perform an investigation for the company's performance in March, May, and October to uncover patterns and trends that impact sales performance and customer engagement during these months.
* Find out the unusual trend in July and December to improve sales and customer engagement during these months.
* Develop targeted marketing campaigns and promotional offers for customers in the Aerospace Defense for customer increase and retention.
Implement customer retention programs and personalised marketing initiatives to maximise customer loyalty business in the Machinery and Industrial Goods and the Paper and Packaging industry.


### 4.2. Market Opportunities

* Optimise the cost of products for Paper and Packaging to maximise the profit of the leading industry for ChemCorp. This is the priority for ChemCorp.
* Perform market expansion for new customers, as well as optimise profit margin of Aerospace Defense.
* Explore more partnerships regarding Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals to leverage more opportunities for these industries in terms of sales and revenue.
* Explore strategies to stimulate demand and increase order volume for Chemical K, set a higher sales target in order to boost their sales.
* Maximising Chemical E’s profit potential by identifying strategies to increase sales and promote its efficiency to target customers.

### 4.3. Product Divestment

* Consider the possibility of discontinuing the sales for the Medical Equipment industry and allocate resources to more profitable sectors.
* Consider the possibility of divesting Chemical G with its high cost, low revenue, and low orders.
* Assess the feasibility of discontinuing product A and J. These products are highly underperformed and may lead to more loss with the current situation, and the resources would be more useful when used in other products.
